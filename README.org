* Mantissa Library: Floating Point in Software

Mostly, this was implemented for fun, and to learn more about the black magic behind floating point numbers in C and C++.

** Building

Dependencies:
- [[https://cmake.org/download/][CMake]]
- A C++ compiler (any will do)

First, generate a build tree using CMake.
#+begin_src sh
  cmake -B bld
#+end_src

Then, invoke the build tree to build the library, tests, and everything else involved with =mantissa=.
#+begin_src sh
  cmake --build bld
#+end_src

** Using

If your project uses CMake, using this library shouldn't be too difficult at all.

First, copy this source tree somewhere locally. Then, in your project's ~CMakeLists.txt~, add a call to ~add_subdirectory~ with a path that points to where you keep the local source tree of =mantissa=. After this, simply use ~target_link_libraries(<your_target> PRIVATE mantissa)~ and ~#include <mantissa.h>~ in your source code where you'd like to use it.
